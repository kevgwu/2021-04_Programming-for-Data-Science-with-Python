In this assignment, I had to create a standalone python script to explore bike data in 3 .csv files. The script prompts users asking what they would like to know (city, month(s), and day(s) of the week) to filter out data accordingly. The script returns some summary statistics depending on the filters selected. All files should be in the same folder and data files unpacked into the same folder.
